---

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django") is a web framework. It can be complicated to learn but is both powerful and versatile as a projects back end. A good choice for complex apps. It uses Python
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/ "React") is a library for front end user interfaces.
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/ "Redux") is a framework that tracks object state. It is used in conjunction with user interfaces like React or Angular.

Directions: 

This post is a technical walkthrough for setting up Django + React + Redux on a Macbook Pro.  It assumes you have already set up a basic Django + Django Rest Framework 'Hello World'.  We'll be starting from there. 

Any line preceeded by a "$" is intended as a terminal command. 

Lines to insert into files will be shown as a code snippet. For example:

**filename:**
{% highlight html %}
line you should copy into file 
{% endhighlight%}

Anytime you see "project_name", change it to the name of your project.
